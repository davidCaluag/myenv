The dataset monitored 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease for six months. The conductors recorded using telemonitoring devices based on their age, gender, time interval, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 other biomedical voice measures. With normalized data, the decision trees regressor, random forest regressor, and gradient-boosting regressor models are best for realizing and capturing trends. These models found a strong correlation between the total UDRPS and subject #, age, and gender. However, the subject number is irrelevant because the it strictly connects to the patient. Age and gender are, of course, relevant because they show a general strong trend for Parkinson's.
